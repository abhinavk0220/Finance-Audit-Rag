This includes both management's and external auditors' evaluations.\n\n2. **Certification of Financial Statements**: Under Section 302, the CEO and CFO must certify the accuracy of financial statements and ensure that internal controls are established and maintained to support reliable financial reporting.\n\n3. **Documentation of Controls**: Companies must maintain thorough documentation of their internal control processes and assessments to demonstrate compliance and address any gaps identified during internal audits.\n\n4. **Real-Time Disclosure**: Section 409 requires companies to disclose material changes in financial conditions or operations in real-time, ensuring that investors are promptly informed of significant developments.\n\n5. **Formal Reporting of Control Weaknesses**: Companies should have a process for formally reporting any identified control weaknesses to external auditors, which is essential for transparency and compliance.\n\n6. **Regular Reviews**: To align with SOX compliance standards, companies may implement regular reviews (such as quarterly reviews) of their internal controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness and address any issues proactively.\n\nThese controls are critical for protecting investor interests and maintaining the integrity of financial reporting.",

This accountability ensures that top management is directly involved in the financial reporting process, which can lead to more diligent oversight and a greater emphasis on the integrity of the financial information presented. Additionally, the requirement for establishing and maintaining internal controls helps to create a framework that supports reliable financial reporting, reducing the likelihood of errors or fraudulent activities.
