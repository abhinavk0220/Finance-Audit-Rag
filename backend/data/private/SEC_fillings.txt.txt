CONFIDENTIAL – INTERNAL USE ONLY  
Draft SEC Filing: Fiscal Year 2024 (Preliminary 10-K)  

Company: Aegis Financial Holdings Inc.  
Period Ending: December 31, 2024  

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures  
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

However, internal audit identified several deficiencies in the segregation of duties within the treasury reconciliation process. Specifically, a single individual had access to both initiate and approve cash transfers. Management has initiated corrective actions to implement dual authorization controls by Q2 2025.  

Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules  
The Company maintains documentation supporting all journal entries exceeding $500,000. Independent auditors reviewed this process in accordance with PCAOB standards and reported no material weaknesses.  

Sub-certification Process  
Each business unit controller is required to provide quarterly sub-certifications regarding compliance with SOX 302 and 404 requirements.  
During Q3 2024, two regional controllers submitted late certifications, and remediation actions are being tracked by Internal Audit.  

Related Party Transactions  
No material related party transactions were identified during fiscal year 2024.  
Any future related party dealings must be disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation S-K, Item 404.  

Risk Management Summary
